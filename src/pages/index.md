## ## Current project

Codename: web

Phase: sketching

Releasing: 2024-12-15

Description:
<br> > website restructuring & redesign

## ## Calendar
Project development will be in 4 stages:
- ðŸŒ– sketch (requirements and ux design)
- ðŸŒ˜ prototype (minimal working version)
- ðŸŒ’ alpha (adding features)
- ðŸŒ” release (refactoring and polishing)

The reason why `lipu` failed is because I restarted and edited it constantly. Its time to learn that
1. there is no editing stage
2. destruction is a form of *done*
3. perfection is boring

Don't get stuck on a project. Make four more.
