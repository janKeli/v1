I keep having problems with this. I *really* want to use the [typestate-pattern](/typestate-pattern) here for intitialization, it would make sense. But I can't either because of how the [zellij-plugins](/zellij-plugins) API is implemented or because I don't understand how to work with it. Anyway, ~~tomorrow~~ 2024-06-21 I'll remove all the plugin code and make it a standalone tool first. Then see if it makes sense to wrap it in a plugin again.

I think [dots](/dots) is at a stage where I can *almost* use it to develop other projects. So I'll install helix on it and move [markdev](/markdev) development there.

Aaaaand [done](/cult-of-done). Now cloned the repo, it's installing the toolchain.

I finally got sick enough of Nvidia to get a new GPU. It's an rx570-8g.

The first thing I did is I went and set up [sway](/sway) because I wanted to do that for quite a while now. I've done that on my host OS, so it's not in the repo.

2024-06-24 I plan to install [dots](/dots) on bare metal. I will need to do a few things today for that to work, though:
- back up the obsidian vault, the work repo and the current config,
- make [dots](/dots)' passwords persistent, so it doesn't reset to `hunter2` on every reboot
- write an install guide

Starting with the password, I thought the best way to do that was to make `passwd` and `shadow` persistent, but that doesn't seem to work. I looked it up and it seems many people use `initialHashedPassword`. I don't know if it's a good idea, but my machine should only really ask a password if you already have physical access to it, which you probably don't.

First, I have to figure out how to structure it. Right now I have a somewhat pure [zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) system with *main* notes and *source* notes. Normally, source notes would be converted into folders. But that comes with the limitation of being unable to source a single note in multiple places. So I'll leave the directory structure flat, as it is now.

I thought of making my own SSG, but that'd be quite unnecessary. So instead I should make something closer to [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export), but
- with MDX support,
- built-in linking
- custom code blocks

And then build that using... Probably [astro](/astro) for its ecosystem (I like [tailwind](/tailwind), for instance).

I now use [dots](/dots) on my primary machine! You can check out the repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/janElikan/dots). If you have any input, please create an issue there!
