I want a single app that would replace newpipe, antennapod and an rss reader. So basically an *RSS reader*/downloader plus *video/audio player*.

Initially I wanted to build it for Android, but I also want it to work on my computer, so I'll use a cross-platform framework.

It must be local-first, everything gets downloaded, everything works offline.

I [wanted an RSS reader](/read-important-things-deeply), *miniflux* looks like a good option, but it's unnecesserally *complicated* for my use-case, it has a server and a client and I *don't want/need a server*. Plus it's *fun to build* things!

<NoteMeta name="lipu-lifecycle" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-05T15:28Z" modified="2024-08-09T13:58Z" />

The *first version* will be just a *CLI*, to test out the idea.

Then it needs a *frontend*, I think [tauri](/tauri) looks good.

Then it needs ompl support and, as it turns out, youtube downloads.

A crate for reading/*creating* rss feeds. See [feed-rs](/feed-rs) as well.
```shell
> cargo add rss
```
```rust
use rss::Channel;
use rss::ChannelBuilder;

fn read() -> Channel {
    let file = std::fs::File::open("feed.xml").unwrap();
    let buffer = std::io::BufReader::new(file);
    Channel::read_from(buffer).unwrap()
}

fn create() -> Channel {
    ChannelBuilder::default()
        .title("Example feed")
        .link("http://example.com/feed")
        .description("Test feed")
        .build()
}
```

Channel has its metadata and `items`:
```rust
struct Item {
    title: Option<String>,
    link: Option<String>,
    description: Option<String>,
    author: Option<String>,
    categories: Vec<Category>,
    comments: Option<String>,
    /// The description of a media object that is attached to the item.
    enclosure: Option<Enclosure>,
    guid: Option<Guid>,
    pub_date: Option<String>,
    /// The RSS channel the item came from.
    source: Option<Source>,
    /// The HTML contents of the item.
    content: Option<String>,
    extensions: ExtensionMap,
    atom_ext: Option<atom::AtomExtension>,
    itunes_ext: Option<itunes::ITunesItemExtension>,
    // some fields omitted
}
```

<NoteMeta name="lipu-oopsie" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T13:49Z" modified="2024-08-07T13:52Z" />

I've tried to use the [rust-rss-crate](/rust-rss-crate) for the project because it's the only one I've heared of. Everything worked fine until I *tried adding more feeds*. I tested it with [fasterthanlime's feed](https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml) and [namtao's youtube feed](https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMHZ1P2iYimObhtHKfPz7gw). The library complained that the feeds didn't have a correct rss version.

So now I'm rewriting the entire thing (which is thankfully very small, so it's not a big deal) to use [feed-rs](/feed-rs).

A crate for reading rss, atom, json feeds.

It has much more *comprehensive types* and supports more formats than the [rust-rss-crate](/rust-rss-crate).

```rust
let feed = parser::parse(xml.as_bytes()).unwrap();
```

<NoteMeta name="no-videos-though" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T14:13Z" modified="2024-08-07T14:19Z" />

I've fixed the previous error, added the No Boilerplate feed, ran the app. It errored out.

Turns out it's not that simple to download things from youtube.

Let's pray that [yt-dlp](/yt-dlp) is written in rust and has a library.

\*checks\*

\*dies\*

And things like youtube-cli are wrappers on top of yt-dlp, so that doesn't help either. I don't want this project to have any system-level dependencies!

I've just realized that I can use iframes. So the simplest, *dumbest solution that will work* is to add an *ArticleBody::YouTube* enum variant, have it be a link and read it in the front-end.

---

<NoteMeta name="no-videos-solution-1" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T14:22Z" modified="2024-08-08T08:19Z" />

After some more ~~googling~~ (duckduckgoing?) I have found the [rusty_ytdl](/rusty_ytdl) crate. I've not found it the first time because it's just a library, with no front-end ~~or apparently I'm just blind~~.

Anyway, I think it's *worth implementing both* because youtube may break something on their end, rendering the [rusty_ytdl](/rusty_ytdl) useless.

Though it makes sense to *start with the [option 0](/no-videos-solution-0)* because it's more lightweight.

The logic part of [lipu](/lipu), rss reader back-end.

Usage:
```rust
use lipu::App;

// App is just a builder to get Vec<Article>
let app: App = App::new().add_feed("https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml");
let articles: Vec<Article> = app.fetch().await;
```

A [CLI app exmaple](https://github.com/janElikan/lipu/blob/main/src/main.rs).

Types:
```rust
pub struct Article {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub source: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub body: ArticleBody,
    pub created: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub updated: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub viewed: Progress,
}

pub enum ArticleBody {
    Text(String),
    Video(MediaPayload),
    Audio(MediaPayload),
    YouTubeLink(String),
}

pub enum Progress {
    None,
    UntilLine(usize),
    UntilSecond(usize),
    Fully,
}

pub struct MediaPayload {

Tauri is a *cross-platform GUI* framework that uses [html](/html), [css](/css) and [javascript](/javascript) as a frontend and [rust](/rust) as a backend.

What makes it *different* from something like [electron](/electron) is that it *uses system webview* instead of depending on chromium.

As a result,
- The apps are small
- It *feels fast*

Install the [system deps](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#system-dependencies). If you're on [nixos](/nixos), I have [made a flake](https://gist.github.com/janElikan/1a0d66b7f059387e44ba232b79af7450).

```shell
> npm create tauri-app@latest -- --rc
> cd <name>
> npm install
> npm run tauri android init
> npm run tauri dev
# or npm run tauri android dev
```

When using git, you *should commit* `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` and, if you are using, them `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`.

Victory indeed, considering that I've spent the last 128 minutes trying to get it to work!

oh wait, I forgot something:

Fixed that, ran it again and now it hang. I think it's okay, that's probably gradle being slow (?)

I'm not very good with ~~plants~~ android and java tooling.

I've noticed a drastic difference between writing the back-end and the front-end for [lipu](/lipu).

The front-end currently uses [react](/react), I run the app continuously and click around to make sure nothing breaks (it does).

The back-end was written in [rust](/rust), I ran it like twice to make sure the thing does everything I want it to. The rest of the time I just had [cargo-clippy](/cargo-clippy) on the right half of the screen and "talked" to it.

*The rust experience really is nicer.*

I *don't love how cards look*, probably gonna get rid of them in a few days.

Also, while I remember, the plan is to eventually *scrape* the website that an article is coming from *if it's allowed* by its `robots.txt`.

I should *tweak the backend* so that if an *item disappears* from the feed (Xe's feed is just the last 10 articles, for example), it should be *kept on the device*.

And the back button doesn't work on mobile because it's a single-page app and I don't catch that event.

And add the zoom for images.

<NoteMeta name="lipu-groups" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-15T14:41Z" modified="2024-08-15T14:47Z" />

I need to *remember to add folders/groups*.

Context: I have discovered that a service we use at *work has an RSS feed*. I don't want to mix the blogs I'm reading with work, so this. Also iirc *mastodon gives you feeds*, it'd be useful for that as well.

<NoteMeta name="lipu-cookies" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-15T14:47Z" modified="2024-08-15T14:48Z" />

Some RSS feeds require you to log in, so the app needs an interface to do that. Should be relatively simple considering the front-end is a webapp and I can just add an iframe with the login form, then pull the cookies to the back-end.

```rust
pub struct Lipu {
    feeds: Vec<String>,
    items: Vec<Item>,
}

trait LipuInterface {
    fn add_feed(&mut self, url: String);
    fn add_mastodon_feed(&mut self, instance: String, user: String);
    async fn add_youtube_channel(&mut self, name: String);
    async fn refresh(&mut self) -> Result<(), ()>;
    fn remove_feed(&mut self, url: &str) -> Result<(), ()>;

    fn list(&self) -> &[Metadata];
    fn search(&self, query: &str) -> &[Metadata];
    fn with_tag(&self) -> &[Metadata];

    fn add_tag(&mut self, item_id: &str, tag: &str) -> Result<(), ()>;
    fn remove_tag(&mut self, item_id: &str, tag: &str) -> Result<(), ()>;
    fn drop_tag(&mut self, tag: &str) -> Result<(), ()>;

    fn load(&self, item_id: &str) -> &Item;
    fn set_viewing_progress(&mut self, item_id: &str, progress: ViewingProgress) -> Result<(), ()>;
    async fn download_item(&mut self, item_id: &str) -> Result<(), ()>;
}
```
This interface does everything that I have outlined [above](/rethinking-lipu), I think. The frontend's job from here is to handle the playback and rendering.

```rust
pub struct Item {
    pub metadata: Metadata,
    pub body: Body,
}

pub struct Metadata {
    pub id: String,

    pub name: String,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,

    pub feed_url: String,
    pub link: Option<String>,
    pub author: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,

    pub created: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub updated: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,

    pub viewed: ViewingProgress,
}

pub enum ViewingProgress {
    Zero,
    UntilParagraph(usize),
    UntilSecond(usize),
    Fully,
}

pub enum Body {
    DownloadLink { mime_type: String, url: String },
    File { mime_type: String, path: PathBuf },
}
```
This new `Body` will contain *text as files* as well, because some feeds don't give you a *full article*, so it *will have to be downloaded* from the website. *Lipu is a reader, not just a list of links.*

I believe [it is implemented now](https://github.com/janElikan/lipu/tree/c2f4e6a2a1b093fa2bc474c92a4399f0d673a27e), or at least a minimal version of it. Clippy is not happy, but what I want right now is a *working prototype*, which I can refactor later. So I'm switching over to the front-end side of things.

I have moved the search logic to the back-end, thinking that react was slow. Now it is still just as slow. I'll try switching to vanilla to see if that fixes anything.

I do really love rust a lot. Especially in contrast to typescript. The *compiler is so much more helpful!* And the standard library's function names make so much sense!

For instance, I realized that I tried to use the raw ID of each resource, which can contain a full url with all the slashes and whatnot, as a filename and the system couldn't create anything because of that. Here's what the solution ended up being:
```rust
let filename: String = item.metadata.id
  .chars()
  .filter(|char| char.is_ascii_alphanumeric())
  .collect();
```

Tauri is funny though: I have ran the app, told it to download something and it restarted. Turns out writing anything into `./` means writing into `src-tauri/` and writing into `src-tauri/` triggers a reload.

I got lipu's *backend to work* how I need it and implemented persistent state, but I *can't figure out* how to *load files* from the *frontend* in [tauri](/tauri). I'll post an update once I work it out. Best case that will be 2024-08-24.

I've narrowed down the problem. I've changed the permissions and the files are now accessible, tested that on `feeds.json`. *I can read them from javascript, but not use them in html, as assets.* I suspect this is because the asset path is wrong, I'll try reading the source of the function that reads a file from backend to understand how to fetch it manually.

Cool, it doesn't, it `invoke`s the backend! And the backend just streams the file :/

Okay, I'll try to make it work tomorrow by making a backend function which I can fetch to get a response as an image. Except wait, can I fetch?

Or [just embedding the image as raw data into html](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20756042/how-to-display-an-image-stored-as-byte-array-in-html-javascript) probably works. At least as a short-term solution. I'll try that now.

No, wait, the permissions are malformed when I'm using the path api. That's a problem for a future me though.

What the heck, it's not the full file? It's only the first 309 lines?

[oh, yeah, right, I forgot about this...](/tauri-channels) Yeah \*sigh\*

Oh, good, no, the permissions are not malformed on the path, I just converted the path to something viewable in html.

Now I've requested it as I did before and took a look at the network tab. Don't know why I didn't do that earlier. *Anyway, I get* `The resource was requested insecurely.`, which is better than no error.

*I'm stuck on this error now*
