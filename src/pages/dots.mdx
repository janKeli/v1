Dts are going to be the dotfiles and provisioning scripts for my devices (2 currently).

I need to work on the machine I'm writing this on, so I can't reinstall the system on it now. What I can do is either dual-boot or make a VM.

Somehow I forgot that I can just make a VM until like 2 days ago. I have 32 gigs of RAM, so I can even leave it running in the background.

So yeah, I'll make a [nixos](/nixos) [virtual-machine](/virtual-machine) and write my dotfiles on that.

<NoteMeta name="dots-empty-machine" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-06-17T21:12Z" modified="2024-07-01T17:54Z" />

I've set up the machine and installed neovim on it. This note will be uploaded after the config, but the dates in the frontmatter are correct.

~~Tomorrow~~ On 2024-06-18 I'll start writing the actual dotfiles.

The machine set up using [quickemu](/quickemu), it's in `~/vms/nixos-unstable-gnome.conf` although it doesn't use gnome. I'll probably rename it later.

Requirements for each machine:
- all *perephirals must be wired*
- *no remote access* except for the server
- *no closed-source services* that have *full access to hardware* (e.g. google assistant)
  - exception: phone vendor's kernel
- all devices can be *set up* either fully or semi-*automatically* using the [dots repo](https://github.com/janElikan/dots) (i.e. no snowflakes)
- the *OS* has to be able to *heal itself* to a point, no system reinstalls

Data:
- the vault is as public/transparent as possible
- all important data is stored in one directory
- that directory is synced across all devices
- compressed, encrypted and backed up weekly

Physical machines:
- workstation <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona suli</span>
- mobile computer <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>
- server, optional

Virtual machines:
- can follow the requirements if they are trusted
- are considered temporary, disposable if they don't

Containers are not treated as machines and do not have to follow these.

Currently, the device that will become <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span> is running LineageOS 21 with no root and no gapps. I'll create a separate user on it to test the concept, then probably format it.

I'll start with the terminal, which it must have as it's a general-purpose computer. There's a project called [nix-on-droid](/nix-on-droid), which I'll try now.

Then I want to see if it can manage system-level APKs.

P.S. No, it can only run as a primary user, so I have to do everything on the current account \*sigh\*.

<NoteMeta name="nix-on-droid" source="https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-07-18T04:52Z" modified="2024-07-18T05:00Z" />

*Nix-on-Droid* lets you run the *nix package manager* on android. It also supports home manager!

Under the hood, it uses termux *proot*, which is a userland hack that partially replaces chroot without requiring sudo.

You can *install* it from [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.nix/). Then it can either be configured like this:
```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  # in ~/.config/nixpkgs/nix-on-droid.nix
  environment.packages = [ pkgs.vim ];
  system.stateVersion = "24.05";
}
```
```shell
> nix-on-droid switch
> nix-on-droid rollback
```

or with a flake:
```nix
{
  description = "Minimal example of Nix-on-Droid system config.";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-24.05";

    nix-on-droid = {
      url = "github:nix-community/nix-on-droid/release-24.05";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nix-on-droid }: {

    nixOnDroidConfigurations.default = nix-on-droid.lib.nixOnDroidConfiguration {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
      modules = [ ./nix-on-droid.nix ];
    };

  };
}
```
```shell
> nix-on-droid switch --impure --flake <path>#device # first time
> nix-on-droid switch --flake <path>#device
```

[nix-on-droid](/nix-on-droid) has generated a flake, I'll now merge it with my main `dots` repo. First, I'll have to refactor the config of THIS device though.

<NoteMeta name="dots-tawa-128-minutes-in" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-07-18T07:47Z" modified="2024-07-18T07:55Z" />

When I started refactoring *dots* for *nix-on-droid*, I thought half of the `configuration.nix` will be shared between both devices. Well no, it won't. I'm not even entirely sure that the package versions will be the same, as <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span> is currently running nixpkgs 24.05.

I also have to switch away from the catppuccin nix module, as it uses a quite few things that simply do not exist on non-nixos systems.

One thing I'm extremely happy about, though! It *doesn't feel like a phone*, like an <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&toki</span>, it's a <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>, a *mobile computer*.

<NoteMeta name="drawing-the-hardware" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-07-18T10:48Z" modified="2024-07-18T13:01Z" />

I'll probably never upload photos, but I want to add pics of my hardware setup to the dots repo (and here, obviously). Also, my site doesn't currently support images, that's a perfect opportunity to fix it!

Update: I'm done with the computer in that pic, gonna get back to the rest later.

<NoteMeta name="device-naming" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-07-19T06:40Z" modified="2024-07-19T06:50Z" />

My *naming scheme* before february 2024 was non-existant. My computer was running pop os, so it was called `ryzen5-pop`. My phone used whatever name the manufacturer gave it.

Then I switched to `LLSSSRRRI`:

| hostname  | Location | System       | Role       | Index | type         |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- | ------------ |
| honixdev0 | *ho*me   | *nix*os      | *dev*box   | 0     | workstation  |
| hodebsrv0 | *ho*me   | *deb*ian     | *s*e*rv*er | 0     | raspberry pi |
| molincli0 | *mo*bile | *lin*eage os | *cli*ent   | 0     | phone        |

But that's a bit extra, considering that at most I will have 3 devices (as stated in [dots-rules](/dots-rules)).

So currently I renamed
- `honixdev0` to `suli`, as in `big computer`
- `molincli0` to `tawa`, as in `portable computer`

Also more on `molincli0`, it was planned to be an ssh client, but now it's a standalone machine, so it'd be wrong to call it `cli0` anymore.

I think I want to give sway another go.

*Reasons*:
- my gnome shortcuts are not configured declaratively
- there are a few apps that I don't want
- I want complete control and configurability of my system
- I want custom launchers
- the tiling addon is not the best thing ever
- not lightweight enough to run a desktop version *on a raspberry pi off a solar panel* (I do own a pi 3b+).
- *my system works too well and I'm bored /lh*

<NoteMeta name="device-vs-machine" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-07-19T15:21Z" modified="2024-07-19T15:25Z" />

Here's where I'm going to draw a distinction going forward:
- a *device* is a physical piece of hardware, whereas
- a *machine* (<span class="sitelen-pona">ilo sona kon</span>) is its OS and configuration

A machine can be transfered between hosts, duplicated or whatever. A *machine* does not exist in meatspace, only a device does.

The naming is bad, I know. If you have any ideas about that, please [let me know](/contact)!

Honestly, the default shortcuts make so much sense that I'm not even gonna touch them for now.

Discord and other apps that try to capture the screen may not work on wayland, use this kde project to fix them.

If I understand correctly, it needs an [xdg-portal](/xdg-portal), here's what I use on [nixos](/nixos) for [sway](/sway):
```nix
xdg.portal.enable = true
xdg.portal.wlr.enable = true
```

Then you just install xwaylandvideobridge, run it in the background and it handles screencap.

I come from DEs, so I'm not very used being able to jump to a specific workspace instead of scrolling through them.

Anyway, here's my current setup:
- 1 for audio/video configuration
- 4 for ad-hoc terminal tasks
- 5 is the main workspace, has obsidian at all times and will *usually* have a terminal
- 6 for firefox
- 10 for a windows VM

I have stated in [dots-rules](/dots-rules) that all of my data must be compressed, encrypted and backed up weekly.

To do that, I'll need:
- [tar](/tar)
- [gpg](/gpg)
- some kind of syncing service (rsync, git?)

I'll go add info that's missing about them and come back here

[Step zero. Humanize.](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4?t=633) I'll make an archive manually:

Everything is ALREADY in one directory, `/nix/persist`:

Of these, I wanna back up:

```shell

There's actually a bit more to the old vault than the notes:

I've found an archived project called `dotfiles`, which says:
> You need to URGENTLY figure out your dotfiles. Store them here, it's fine. Make a quick setup script.

That took a year, but eventually I executed it exactly as planned. The dotfiles were stored in the vault, among other things:

The only thing I still haven't migrated from is the `pass` directory. It was tied to the old GPG key and had some info that I don't want anymore.

How should I *store passwords*?

I use gpg with gnu pass, so that's easy. But how do I back them up? I currently have 2 copies of the private key: on <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona suli</span> and <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>. But what if I loose both? What of the off-site backup? Good that I will have the data, but *I won't be able to recover it*!

I'll push a commit when I'm done if I don't break my system /lh

P.S. I didn't break my system.

Since I've moved the folder, syncthing is no longer working. Fixing that is trivial, syncthing's web gui is very nice. I wanted to sync the entire `/nix/persist`, but a few smaller directories will work better as *syncthing doesn't recommend syncing git repos*.

- Discord likes there to be a physical (or virtual) microphone, it's not very comfortable with other applications feeding their audio into it
- It works in firefox, but I've messed up something in my config
- Also I wanted a clean firefox setup for a while,
- *So I'm switching to librewolf*

I've tried running discord in that, everything worked, then I exited the browser, re-launced it and was pleasantly surprised with my cookies being auto-deleted. I like this browser!

I don't *really* know how this works, so check out the source, but here's the snippet I use for adding virtual audio devices:
```nix
services.pipewire.extraConfig.pipewire."91-null-sinks" = {
  "context.objects" = [
    {
      factory = "spa-node-factory";
      args = {

        "node.name"        = "Dummy-Driver";
        "priority.driver"  = 8000;
      };
    }
    {
      factory = "adapter";
      args = {
        "factory.name"     = "support.null-audio-sink";
        "node.name"        = "Microphone-Proxy";
        "node.description" = "Microphone";
        "media.class"      = "Audio/Source/Virtual";
        "audio.position"   = "MONO";
      };
    }
    {
      factory = "adapter";
      args = {
        "factory.name"     = "support.null-audio-sink";
        "node.name"        = "Main-Output-Proxy";
        "node.description" = "Main Output";
        "media.class"      = "Audio/Sink";
        "audio.position"   = "FL,FR";
      };
    }
  ];

Turns out it works if you either
1. use an extension that connects a pipewire node to webrtc, or
2. enable `resistFingerprinting`, rendering Discord unable to select inputs and outputs on its own and break itself

If you have any other ideas on how to do that, please tell me! Any ideas, hacks count!

1. it is very slow. Thanks to nix, I can work on any device, but this one is slow. Especially due to to proot.
2. no services. That is expected, I can't have access to its init system.
3. fs can be flaky. I tried `tar -xf` on a file and it failed with something like `No such file or directory`

I'll probably try rooting the device later to see if that helps with anything. It would sure allow me to avoid proot!
